# Soupkitchens and Foodpantries Finder

This is a prototype of my Code for Philly food justice project, that's also the Rails Portfolio Project for my Flatiron School FulLStack Developer Program.  The idea has a winding history, but this iteration comes from a conversation with an official at the Dept of Public Health that went something like, "What I really need is a Yelp for soup kitchens and food pantries." This is the poorest large city in the nation, and nearly 30% of the population relies on institutions like soupkitchens and foodpantries. Once done, it can be easily adapted for any city or town. 



In the web app's current form, you can check out reviews of soup kitchens and foodpantries. If you sign up/sign in, you can add your own. In October 2018 it is being refactored into a Rails API with JavaScript frontend, with several single page renders. Though still in process, it will eventually have an admin button to load local data in CSF format. 




## Installation/Development

Uses Ruby 2.3.1 and Rails 5.2.0.
Fork, copy the files to your local machine, $ bundle install
