# Philly Soupkitchen Finder

This is a prototype of my Code for Philly food justice project, that's also the Rails Portfolio Project for my Flatiron School FulLStack Developer Program. The idea has a winding history, but this iteration comes from a conversation with an official at the Dept of Public Health that went something like, "What I really need is a Yelp for soup kitchens and food pantries." This is the poorest large city in the nation, and nearly 30% of the population relies on institutions like soupkitchens and foodpantries.

In the web app's current form, you can check out reviews of soup kitchens and add your own. While some of the soupkitchens' names are taken from actual Philly soupkitchens, I used Sesame Street characters to be my test users. In a next iteration, I'll enter the entire data set of Philly soup kitchens, using the CSF format they're currently in, and then move on to include the food pantries. 

UPDATE: In October 2018, I changed the design of Soupkitchens to a Rails API and JavaScript frontend, moving it toward becoming a Single Page App.
